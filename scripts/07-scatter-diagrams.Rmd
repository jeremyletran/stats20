## Introduction

The easiest way to plot scatter diagrams in R is with the `plot()` function.
I should say that `plot()` produces different kinds of plots depending on the
type of input(s) that you pass to it.

If you pass two numeric variables (i.e. two R vectors) `x` and `y`, `plot()`
will produce a scatter diagram. For example, consider the `height` and `weight` 
variables of the following toy data table:

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(xtable)
dat = data.frame(
  name = c('Luke', 'Leia', 'Obi-Wan', 'Yoda', 'Chebacca'),
  sex = c('male', 'female', 'male', 'male', 'male'),
  height = c(172, 150, 182, 66, 228),
  weight = c(77, 49, 44, 78, 112)
)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE}
xtb <- xtable(dat, digits = 2)
print(xtb, comment = FALSE, type = 'latex',
      include.rownames = FALSE)
```

To make a scatter diagram with `height` and `weight`, you can create two 
vectors and pass them to `plot()`:

```{r out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.width=3, fig.height=3.5}
height = c(172, 150, 182, 66, 228)  # in centimeters
weight = c(77, 49, 44, 78, 112)     # in kilograms

# default scatter diagram
plot(height, weight)
```

If you pass a factor to `plot()` it will produce a bar-chart:

```{r out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.width=2.5, fig.height=3.5}
# qualitative variable (as an R factor)
sex = factor(c('male', 'female', 'male', 'male', 'male'))

# default scatter diagram
plot(sex)
```


Note that `plot()` displays a very simple, and kind of ugly, scatter diagram. 
This not an accident. In fact, the basic plots in R follow a "quick and dirty" 
approach. They are not publication quality, but that is OK. The default display
of `plot()` was not designed to produce pretty graphics, but rather to produce
visualizations that quickly allow you to explore the data, identify patterns, 
help you ask new research questions, and then move on with more visualizations
or to the next analytical stages.

Although `plot()` produces a basic graph, you can use several arguments, or
graphical parameters, to obtain a nicer chart. To find more information about 
the available graphical parameters for `plot()`, take a look at the documentation
provided by `help(plot)`.

The following code uses various graphical parameters to display a more visually
appealing scatter diagram:

```{r out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.width=4, fig.height=4.5}
# nicer scatter diagram
plot(height, weight, 
     las = 1,         # orientation of y-axis tick marks 
     pch = 19,        # filled dots
     col = '#598CDD', # color of dots
     xlab = 'Height (cm)',   # x-axis label
     ylab = 'Weight (kg)',   # y-axis label
     main = 'Height -vs- Weight scatter diagram')
```


## Adding points and lines

Often, you may want to add more points and/or line(s) to a given plot. When
you use `plot()`, you add points with `points()`, and lines with `abline()`.

For example, say you want to add the point of averages. First, get the
averages:

```{r}
avg_height = mean(height)
avg_weight = mean(weight)
```

Once you have the coordinates of the point of averages, you can `plot()` again 
the scatter diagram, adding the point of averages with `points()`:

```{r out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.width=4, fig.height=4.5}
# scatter diagram
plot(height, weight, 
     las = 1,         # orientation of y-axis tick marks 
     pch = 19,        # filled dots
     col = '#598CDD', # color of dots
     xlab = 'Height (cm)',   # x-axis label
     ylab = 'Weight (kg)',   # y-axis label
     main = 'Height -vs- Weight scatter diagram')
# point of averages
points(avg_height, avg_weight, pch = 19, cex = 2, col = "tomato")
```


Another common task involves adding one or more lines to a scatter diagram
produced by `plot()`. One option to achieve this task is via the `abline()`
function. Here's an example showing the previous scatter diagram, with two
guide lines corresponding to the point of averages

```{r out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.width=4, fig.height=4.5}
# scatter diagram
plot(height, weight, 
     las = 1,         # orientation of y-axis tick marks 
     pch = 19,        # filled dots
     col = '#598CDD', # color of dots
     xlab = 'Height (cm)',   # x-axis label
     ylab = 'Weight (kg)',   # y-axis label
     main = 'Height -vs- Weight scatter diagram')
# guide lines for point of avgs
abline(h = avg_weight, v = avg_height, col = "tomato")
# point of averages
points(avg_height, avg_weight, pch = 19, cex = 2, col = "tomato")
```

The argument `h` is used to specify the y-value for _horizontal_ lines; 
the argument `v` is used to specify the x-value for _vertical_ lines.

If what you want is to specify a line with intercept `a` and slope `b`, then
specify these arguments inside `abline()`:

```{r out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.width=4, fig.height=4.5}
# scatter diagram
plot(height, weight, 
     las = 1,         # orientation of y-axis tick marks 
     pch = 19,        # filled dots
     col = '#598CDD', # color of dots
     xlab = 'Height (cm)',   # x-axis label
     ylab = 'Weight (kg)',   # y-axis label
     main = 'Height -vs- Weight scatter diagram')
# guide lines for point of avgs
abline(h = avg_weight, v = avg_height, col = "tomato")
# line with intercep and slope
abline(a = 40, b = 0.3, col = "gray50", lty = 2, lwd = 2)
# point of averages
points(avg_height, avg_weight, pch = 19, cex = 2, col = "tomato")
```



## Scatter diagrams with `ggplot2`

Another approach to create scatter diagrams in R is to use functions from the 
package `"ggplot2"`. This package provides a different philosophy to define
graphs, and it also produces plots with visual attributes carefully chosen
to provide prettier plots.

You should have the package `"ggplot2"` already installed, since you were 
supposed to use it for HW02. Assuming that this is the case, you need to load 
`"ggplot2"` with the function `library()` in order to start using its functions:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
```

One of the major differences between basic plots---like those produced by `plot()`---and graphics with `ggplot()`, is that the latter requires the data 
to be in the form of a data frame:

```{r}
dat = data.frame(
  name = c('Luke', 'Leia', 'Obi-Wan', 'Yoda', 'Chewbacca'),
  sex = c('male', 'female', 'male', 'male', 'male'),
  height = c(172, 150, 182, 66, 228),
  weight = c(77, 49, 44, 78, 112)
)
```

To create a scatter diagram with `"ggplot2"`, type the following commands:

```{r out.width='40%', fig.align='center', fig.width=3, fig.height=3}
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = height, y = weight)) +
  geom_point()
```

- The main input of `ggplot()` is `data` which takes the name of the data 
frame containing the variables.
- The `aes()` function---inside `ggplot()`---allows you to specify which 
variables will be used for the `x` and `y` positions.
- The `+` operator is used to add a _layer_, in this case, the layer corresponds
to `geom_point()`
- The function `geom_point()` specifies the type of geometric object to be 
displayed: points (since we want a scatter diagram with dots). 

As you can tell, the default chart produced by `ggplot()` is nicer than the
one produced with `plot()`. You can customize the previous graph to add more
details:

```{r out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = height, y = weight)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Height -vs- Weight scatter diagram")
```

Here's another example of a scatter diagram that includes labels for each dot:

```{r out.width='60%', fig.align='center', fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = height, y = weight)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(label = name), hjust=0, vjust=0) +
  xlim(0, 300) +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Height -vs- Weight scatter diagram")
```

Adding specific points with `ggplot()` is a bit trickier. This is because
you need to provide data to `ggplot()` in the form of a data.frame. In order 
to plot the point of averages with `ggpot()`, we need to create a data frame
for such a point:

```{r}
# data frame for the point of averages
avgs = data.frame(height = avg_height, weight = avg_weight)
avgs
```

One way to add the point of averages is to use `geom_point()` twice: one for 
the heighths and weights of the individuals, and the second time for the 
point of averages:

```{r out.width='60%', fig.align='center', fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = height, y = weight)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_point(data = avgs, aes(x = height, y = weight), 
             col = "tomato", size = 4) +
  geom_text(aes(label = name), hjust=0, vjust=0) +
  xlim(0, 300) +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Height -vs- Weight scatter diagram")
```

Finally, here's how to add guide lines for the point of averages:

```{r out.width='60%', fig.align='center', fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = height, y = weight)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_point(data = avgs, aes(x = height, y = weight), 
             col = "tomato", size = 4) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = avg_height, col = 'tomato') +
  geom_hline(yintercept = avg_weight, col = 'tomato') +
  geom_text(aes(label = name), hjust=0, vjust=0) +
  xlim(0, 300) +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Height -vs- Weight scatter diagram")
```

# Regression Scatterplot for Pearson's Height data

This is a Shiny app that generates a scatter diagram to illustrate the regression method using Pearson's heights data set.


## Motivation

The goal is to provide a visual display of some of the concepts from __Statistics, Chapter 10: Regression__ (pages 158-165):

- Point of averages
- SD line
- Graph of averages
- Regression line
- Correlation coefficient

Reference: "Statistics" by David Freedman, Robert Pisani and Roger Purves (2007). Fourth Edition. Norton & Company.

- `Father`: The father's height, in inches
- `Son`: The height of the son, in inches

The app only uses variables: `Father, Mother, Child`
